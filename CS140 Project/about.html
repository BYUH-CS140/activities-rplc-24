      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <p>Welcome! This project is very close to my heart. My mission is to share the flavors and stories of the Filipino food I grew up with. For me, these recipes are more than just instructions; they are memories of family gatherings, celebrations, and the comfort of a home-cooked meal. My goal is to translate that warmth and joy into an online experience. I want to demystify Filipino cooking and invite everyone, regardless of their background, to pull up a chair at the virtual Filipino dinner table and experience the love that goes into every dish.</p>

      <h2>Why This Site?</h2>
      <p>I created this website because I believe that food is one of the most powerful tools we have for cultural exchange. While many are familiar with other Asian cuisines, I've often felt that Filipino food deserves a brighter spotlight on the world stage. This site is my small contribution to that effort. It combines my personal love for the rich and diverse flavors of my heritage with the practical application of my studies in web design at BYUâ€“Hawaii. My goal is to create a space that is not only a recipe hub but also a starting point for conversations about culture, family, and the shared joy of a good meal.</p>
