    <p>Chicken Inasal is a beloved grilled dish from Bacolod, marinated in a mix of calamansi, vinegar, garlic, ginger, and annatto oil. It is traditionally cooked over charcoal, giving it a smoky flavor and irresistible aroma that locals and tourists alike crave. This dish is typically served with rice and dipping sauces, and it is a staple in street stalls and Inasal specialty restaurants across Negros Occidental.</p>
    <p>What makes Chicken Inasal distinct is the marinade that penetrates deep into the meat, paired with basting during grilling using annatto oil to give it a vibrant golden-brown hue. It’s not only delicious but also a cultural icon—featured prominently during local celebrations and fiestas. Inasal is more than food in Negros Occidental; it’s a flavorful expression of tradition and community.</p>

    <p>Piaya is a flat, unleavened bread filled with muscovado sugar and sometimes flavored with ube or mango. It is a famous delicacy from Negros Occidental and is often cooked on a griddle, giving it a slightly crisp outer layer and a soft, gooey center. The use of muscovado sugar, a local product, gives piaya its signature sweet taste that makes it a favorite pasalubong or gift from the region.</p>
    <p>This sweet treat is best enjoyed warm and freshly cooked, where the caramelized filling contrasts beautifully with the flaky, toasted exterior. Piaya not only delights the taste buds but also reflects the province's long-standing sugar heritage. You can find it in souvenir shops, markets, and even airport stalls, proudly representing Negros' love for sugar and craftsmanship in its food culture.</p>

    <p>Kansi is a traditional Negrense soup made with beef shank and bone marrow, uniquely flavored with batwan fruit, which gives it a tangy taste. It is often described as a cross between bulalo and sinigang, combining the richness of slow-cooked meat with the sourness that awakens the palate. The bone marrow melts into the broth, creating a silky texture that's hearty and warming.</p>
    <p>This dish is typically served piping hot with steamed rice and is especially comforting during rainy days or special family gatherings. The inclusion of local ingredients like batwan highlights the culinary identity of Negros Occidental, making kansi not just a meal but a cultural experience. It's a must-try for anyone wanting to explore authentic Negrense cuisine.</p>
